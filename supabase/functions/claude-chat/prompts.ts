}

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Always use "rich_text" instead of "text" for text content
2. Every block must include "object": "block"
3. Follow the exact Notion API block structure
4. Include database_properties for database templates
5. Provide realistic sample_data when relevant
6. Use proper nesting for all properties
7. Include color options for select/multi_select fields`;
